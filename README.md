# LieGeomKernel

`LieGeomKernel` is a library that implements calculations with heat and Mat√©rn kernels
on compact Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces as well as non-compact symmetric spaces.

This is a prototypical implementation for the methods described in `Stationary Kernels and Gaussian Processes on Lie Groups
and their Homogeneous Spaces`, a two-part paper by I. Azangulov, A. Smolensky, A. Terenin and V. Borovitskiy.

## Spaces of interest
The following spaces are implemented:
- Special orthogonal group `SO(n)` (*n*-by-*n* orthogonal matrices of determinant 1),
- Special unitary group `SU(n)` (*n*-by-*n* unitary matrices of determinant 1),
- Stiefel manifold `S(n,m)` (collections of *m* orthonormal vectors in the *n*-space), including hypersphere `S^n`,
- Grassmann manifold `Gr(n,m)` (*m*-dimensional subspaces in the *n*-space), including projective spaces `P^n` and oriented Grassmannians,
- Hyperbolic space `H^n`,
- Symmetric positive-definite matrices `SPD(n)`.

## Showcase

Alas, it's only the code for now...

## Installation and dependencies

Under construction...
